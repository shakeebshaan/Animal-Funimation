The drum has short, stubby legs with orange sneakers, a happy, wide-eyed expression, and two drumsticks crossed casually in front of its circular body. Black, bold outlines define the drum's shape and features. Its face is white with a tiny black nose and smiling mouth. The straps are bright red.

Same character and background as frame 1 and 2. The drum is now fully off the ground, having jumped slightly. The drumsticks are raised high above its head, ready to strike its surface.
