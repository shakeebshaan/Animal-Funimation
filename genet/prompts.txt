The Genet has shifted its weight slightly, and its tail is now curved a bit more dramatically upwards. Its front paws are now slightly closer together as if it's about to pounce. Bold black outlines, flat colors, child-friendly style. Square 1024x1024 pixels.

FRAME 3:
Vector-style illustration of the same Genet, same background. The Genet's head and eyes remain in the EXACT SAME position as Frame 1 & 2. The Genet is now leaping forward, its front paws extended. Its tail is fully extended behind it, curved upwards at the tip. Bold black outlines, flat colors, child-friendly style. Square 1024x1024 pixels.
