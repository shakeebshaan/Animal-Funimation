Only the Chickadee's tail feathers are slightly fanned out and its body rotates very slightly to the right as if beginning to hop upwards.

The branch remains in the same position. The Chickadee's wings are now spread, angled upwards. Its tail feathers are fully fanned, and its legs are dangling below, as if it has just launched into flight.
